Any person has her own friendly colors, a palette of colors.
First you have to know her chromatic features:
- Skin color
- Eye color
- Hair color
Then try to determine her:
- Undertone
- Value
- Contrast
- Intensity
Then a palette based on the four seasons:
- Spring: bright and sunny of bouquet
- Summer: delicate and cold(!) like sand and acquamerine
- Autumn: warm and deep nuances of a forest tinged by reds and yellows
- Winter: cold and stronger opposite colors like the white of the snow and the dark blue of the night
